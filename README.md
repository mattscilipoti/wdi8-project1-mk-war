# Tech in "play"!

<p>- HTML5</p>
<p>- CSS3</p>
<p>- Bootstrap CSS Framework</p>

# Approach Taken
<p>- I decided to first start with my pseudo code to get my basic ideas organized.</p>
<p>- I created User Stories so that I can easily break down simple ideas and elaborate on them.</p>
<p>- From the User Stories I tested 3 lines of code at a time, saved, and refreshed.</p>
<p>- Slowly but surely piece by piece, with help from my peers, the game started taking the form you see before you today. =)</p>

# Unsolved Problems
<p>- I was not able to code out the "I, De,-clare, War" portion of the game. I will revisit that functionality after further research. =D</p>

# User Stories
-Some of my favorite User Stories are:
<p>I want to create an "I, Declare, WAR!" game so that I can play the game in the browser and look cool in front of my friends. [X]</p>
<p>As the game, I want it to be able to randomly sort through the cards in the deck so that they can be shuffled later. [X]</p>
<p>As the game, I want it to be able to shuffle the cards so that the game will work properly.[X]</p>
<p>As the game, once there are no cards left I want the game to start so that the users can start enjoying the flow of the game. [X]</p>
<p>As the game, once each user plays a card it should evaluate the highest card and declare a winner. [X]</p>
